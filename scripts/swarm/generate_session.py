"""NotebookLM session executor — the eleven steps, as one command.

Restores the original EthOS operating shape: the operator supplies a target,
the vault supplies the procedure and the state. Recovered from
`Dr mahmoud AI course/.claude/skills/ethos/SKILL.md:192-232` and recorded in
`30-research/_lanes/ethos-generation-method/`.

Two things this deliberately does NOT do:

* It does not go through the notebooklm MCP wrapper. The MCP exposes no file
  upload, which is what stopped the first L1-s1 run. The library underneath it
  has `sources.add_file`, and image sources work. The MCP was the wrong surface,
  never a missing capability.
* It does not upload EVIDENCE-class assets. NotebookLM redraws image sources,
  and a redrawn screenshot of MakeCode code is plausible, wrong, and hard to
  spot. Evidence is reserved as a blank region and overlaid after export.

Run under the notebooklm venv for a real run:

    C:/Users/ET/mcp-servers/notebooklm-mcp/.venv/Scripts/python.exe
        scripts/swarm/generate_session.py L1-s1 --live

Dry run is the default and needs no venv, no network, and no quota.
