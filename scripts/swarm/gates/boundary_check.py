"""Detect trainer-only content leaking into student-facing output.

Brain OS, Academy_Language_and_Output_Rules.md, Student-Facing Content Rule:
student-facing outputs must NOT include trainer scripts, trainer timing,
internal trainer notes, assessment checklists, classroom management notes,
private methodology, or long pedagogical explanations.

The marker list below covers the leaks that name themselves. Two items of that
rule have no reliable surface form and are NOT checked here — private
methodology and long pedagogical explanation are judged by agent/human review
per `00-contracts/brand-and-output.md` §6.
